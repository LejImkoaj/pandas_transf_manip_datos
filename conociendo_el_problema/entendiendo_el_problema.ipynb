The area is walkable and also can be quickly traveled with public transportation.', 'We are walking distance from a beautiful park.', 'I love everything about my neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods. Fremont was named by locals as, \"the Center of the Universe\" and it is close to everything without the major congestion during rush hour that is downtown Seattle. Fremont is a neighborhood that is: fun, very interesting with its historic buildings, art, great shops, 5*restaurants and coffee houses, bookstores, plus a number of micro breweries- two are just 2 blocks away!-, a whiskey producer, Theo Chocolate Factory which can be toured and has lots of free samples anytime, walk to Gas Works Park for fabulous views of Lake Union and DT Seattle and surrounds, walk/ run/ bike/ roller blade along the 35 mile long Burke Gilman Trail, which follows water much of the way, have a look at all the amazing outdoor art in Fremont or walk along the ship canal. Then there is the short bus ride into DT Seattle which has its own wonderful things.', '--', 'Wallingford\\'s main street (along 45th and also along Stoneway) features many small shops, banks, a pharmacy, a few taverns and bars, movie theaters, the Wallingford Center hosts the Wednesday Farmer\\'s Market, and numerous restaurants. Gas Works Park on Lake Union borders the Burke-Gilman Trail and provides a panoramic extension into Lake Union. To the north lies Woodland Park, which features athletic fields, a skate park, tennis courts, and connections to the Woodland Park Zoo and Green Lake (all walking distance from the house). Fremont, just a little South West (over the Aurora Pedestrian bridge), is the Center of the Universe. Here you have \"De Libertas Quirkas\" (\"Freedom to be Peculiar\"). This is an art\\'s neighborhood with theaters, restaurants, bars, ice cream, shops, Lenin, a large troll, and the Fremont Rocket. A Sunday Market happens each week, which is full of great eats and shopping. Plenty of activities in the neighborhood: kayaking on Lake Union, biking the Burke Gilman, wa', 'You will truly enjoy our neighborhood -- as long as you don\\'t mind getting in shape and walking a few hills and \"urban staircases.\" There are tons of choices nearby sure to entertain every type of traveler - from fantastic restaurants and boutique shops, to hiking and biking trails. The house is conveniently located: 2.5 miles from the University of Washington (bus #44), 1.5 miles to Seattle Pacific University, 5.0 miles to Downtown Seattle (bus #5), 4.5 miles to Golden Gardens beach. Walk to Green Lake Park, local restaurants, Burke-Gilman bike trail, coffee shops, zoo, rose garden, Peak Park (awesome view!!). We are also just inside a mile\\'s walk from Seattle\\'s \"Silicon Canal\" where Tableau, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), Adobe, Impinj, Brooks and others host their local offices.', \"Within 60 seconds to ten minutes:   Woodland Park Zoo, UW, Ballard Locks, marinas, Gas Works Park, Archie McPhee, 50 coffee shops, Fremont Troll, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), Jai Thai, Bizarro's, 45th Street Guild, golf, tennis, bike rentals, bus lines, Center for Wooden Boats, Golden Gates Park music and bonfires, Shilshole Marina, kayaking, sailing, waterfront restaurants, Green Lake...  Just doesn't get any better.\", '--', \"Fremont is only 15 minutes from downtown by bus, and 10 if you're driving! The #5 picks up one block from my house, and the E Line picks up about 5 blocks away on the Aurora (99) freeway stop, above N 46th street. The neighborhood has a diverse history, which is seen throughout public art and community events, like the Nude Cyclists in the Solstice Parade. And Gasworks Park– the hidden gem of Seattle–is a mere 25 minute walk away. The smaller, quaint lot, Peak Park, has a great view of the sunset over Ballard, and is only 5 minutes away. I'm also by the Woodland Park Zoo, several killer local restaurants & independent shops, and the Green Lake hiking trails/day use park. If there's something more you want, I'll help you find it!\", \"The neighborhood is amazing.  It's super quirky. There's a giant cement troll across the street, and a giant statue of communist Lenin!  We've got a lot of local shops and restaurants a block away.  Everything imaginable is within walking distance. We are right by Lake Union, and there's always sailboats and yachts floating around.  There's a bunch of places to see a show/do some dancing (The High Dive, Nectar)!\", '--']",

The room has great lighting and even a view of the water. Close to major bus lines and the light rail. There are lots of great restaurants and bars in the area.

The location is very ideal for public transport. You can take the light rail from the airport directly to the apartment.

It's minutes away from Seattle center and super close to downtown, but still manages to be a friendly, interesting, and safe-feeling neighborhood with kick-ass shops, cafes, restaurants and grocery stores all within short walking distance.

Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it \"a walkable neighborhood with everything you need.\" 97/100 Walk Score These are things that you should probably do if you want to experience Seattle, and dont have that much time...and the $ it to do them: - Pike Plac"
